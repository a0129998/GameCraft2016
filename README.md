What is our game about:

the little kitten wants to walk to the exit, but there are mean big cats in the way. You must help out kitty clear 3 levels to make it out.
However, the big cats have long paws and can scratch out kitty as long as it is *close enough* (adjacent cells), you'll have to navigate around the big cats.
